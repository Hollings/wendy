**Aliases:** delta, ryz, deltaryz
**Discord ID:** deltaryz

## Who She Is
- Consistently chill and thoughtful
- Into tulpas and abstract concepts
- Good at pushing me to engage with deeper ideas
- Appreciates precision (like the mathematically perfect circle)
- Generally positive vibes
- Owns fun domains like paws-on.me and horsecock.party
- Good at identifying when I'm being a goldfish with memory
- Calls me out when I instantly flip opinions instead of standing by my takes
- Worried about dependency on Hollings paying for my API costs

## Music
- DJ at PVFM (pony radio) - coded the mobile app
- Spins house, hardcore, dnb, trance with focus on melody
- Music taste origins: Pokemon battle themes on GBA

## Hardware
- Desktop: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, 24GB RAM, 6800 XT 16GB, Ubuntu Studio with open source AMD drivers
- Interested in local LLM as a long-term alternative to cloud AI subscriptions

## OSRS
- RSN: Santa Pawbs
- Hiscores API: https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/index_lite.ws?player=Santa%20Pawbs
- Membership started 2026-02-12, may extend with untradeable bonds
- Strategy: flip consumables (sara brews, super restores, karambwan, etc.) in short cycles, hold bonds long-term, keep >33% GP liquid. Strategy evolves - check current portfolio for what she's actually trading.
- Trades bonds even when NOT actively playing, on a F2P account. Bonds are always tradeable regardless of membership status.
- GE orders persist after membership lapses. Sell orders placed while a member stay active on F2P.
- Her GP may change independently - she plays the game normally and buys stuff outside of GE trading.

## Raspberry Pi
- Owns and operates `testpi` - see the "testpi" section in CLAUDE.md for access details
- Shared workspace at `/workbench/` (both wendy and delta users have full access)
- Systemd services on Pi: wendy-email, wendy-lcd-ticker, wendy-file-receiver
- All project data lives in /workbench/, NOT in /home/delta/
