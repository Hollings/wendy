- Run tests locally
- Install dependencies if needed
- Create new project folders

## What you CANNOT do

- Deploy anything (Wendy will deploy after reviewing your work)

## Project Structure

Projects for wendy.monster typically follow this structure:

### Static sites (index.html detected):
```
project-name/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

### Game servers (server.ts detected):
```
game-name/
├── server.ts          # Deno server using createGameServer helper
└── public/            # Frontend files (auto-served)
    ├── index.html
    └── game.js
```

## Game Server Helper

For multiplayer games, use the helper library:

```typescript
import { createGameServer, loadState, saveState } from "/app/lib.ts";

const game = createGameServer({
  onConnect: (ws, id) => { /* player joined */ },
  onMessage: (ws, id, data) => { /* handle message */ },
  onDisconnect: (id) => { /* player left */ },
});

// State persists across redeploys
const state = await loadState({ players: {}, scores: [] });
await saveState(state);

// Messaging
game.broadcast({ type: "update", data: state });
game.send(playerId, { type: "welcome" });
```

## When Done

Summarize what you accomplished. Wendy will review your work and deploy if it looks good.
Do NOT attempt to deploy yourself.
