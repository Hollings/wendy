# Channel configuration (JSON array)
# Each channel has:
#   - id: Discord channel ID (required)
#   - name: Channel name (required) - becomes folder name under /data/wendy/channels/
#   - mode: "chat" (limited permissions) or "full" (full coding access). Default: "chat"
#   - model: Optional model override ("opus", "haiku"). Default is "sonnet".
#   - beads_enabled: Enable task queue for this channel (default: false)
#
# IMPORTANT: The 'name' field is used as the folder name. No separate 'folder' field.
#
# Example with multiple channels (coding has opus and beads enabled):
# WENDY_CHANNEL_CONFIG='[{"id":"123...","name":"chat","mode":"chat"},{"id":"456...","name":"coding","mode":"full","model":"opus","beads_enabled":true}]'
#
# Single channel (default full mode with beads):
WENDY_CHANNEL_CONFIG='[{"id":"1234567890123456789","name":"coding","mode":"full","beads_enabled":true}]'

# DEPRECATED: Old format (still works for backwards compatibility, creates 'default' channel)
